# Space Tourism

This is my submission for the [Space Tourism Multi-Page
challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3/hub/space-tourism-multipage-website-63ZRYlngr) on Frontend Mentor.

I decided to use this challenge as an opportunity to learn
the much talked about [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) framework. I have been using
ReactJS for over a year and decided to get my hands dirty with
the latest ReactJS frameworks. I love how Gatsby takes care of
the website optimization, letting me focus on the functionality and design
of the website. I also enjoyed using the different plugins available like,
[gatsby-plugin-image](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-image) and
[gatsby-transformer-json](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-transformer-json/).

In this project, I got to use basic GraphQL queries and understood
the various capabilities of GraphQL.

I really enjoyed learning this great framework and hope to use it
in my future projects!
